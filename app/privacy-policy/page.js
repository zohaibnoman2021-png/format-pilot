      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-3">3. Data Retention & Security</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Some third-party services may be integrated (e.g., analytics, hosting, or image
        storage providers like Cloudinary). These providers follow their own privacy
        standards, which comply with data-protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA.
